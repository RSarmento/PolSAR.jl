# This programm takes a starting pixel (start) from the source data (a conection to a file with sourceHeight and sourceWidth) and 
# builds an image (which has zoomHeight and zoomWidth) into a window (with dimentions windowHeight and windowWidth).

  # SETTING CONSTANTS:
  # The array in which is going to be stored the needed values from the source data needs and index variable different
  # from the tipical i or j form the loops.
  index = 1

  # The source data is stored in binary with 16 bits per pixel (8 for the real part, 8 for the imaginary part), so there are no 
  # header bits, and start is multiplied by 8 in order to skip pixels accordingly.
  start *= 8

  # variables)

  # SETTING POINTER:
  # Here we get the position of the last pickable pixel in the line, setting the conection to 0 (the beginning) and then to the desired
  # beginning of the upcomming image, then it is skiped to it's width (remember that each pixel is 8 bits), then saved for further use
  # and finally reset to 0

  # Calculates the proportion in which the rows and columns pixels are skiped. Back is needed because each access in the source file 
  # pixels automatically moves the pointer.

  # FIRST LINE READING:
  
  # The order in which the pixels are accessed is important
  # The last access can't be followed buy a skip(conection, 8*widthPace),
  # the reason being is that the automatical skip when the position is
  # accessed in the source file is not accounted in the pace calculus

  # ALL THE REMAINING LINES:

  # After the first line is read, probably there are n != widthPace, making
  # the continuous pace place the new line before or after it should begin to be 
  # alligned. To correct that, the moduloPosition is calculated
  # using the modulo operation to find where the pointer is at in relation with
  # the windowWidth, then the skipAux is calculated, taking in consideration also the
  # heightPace, the pointer is moved, and the new line can begin alligned with the first.
